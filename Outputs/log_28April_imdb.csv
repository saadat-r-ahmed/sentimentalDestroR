"I grew up (b. 1965) watching and loving the Thunderbirds. All my mates at school watched. We played ""Thunderbirds"" before school, during lunch and after school. We all wanted to be Virgil or Scott. No one wanted to be Alan. Counting down from 5 became an art form. I took my children to see the [[movie]] hoping they [[would]] get a glimpse of what I loved as a child. How [[bitterly]] [[disappointing]]. The only [[high]] point was the snappy theme tune. Not that it could compare with the original score of the Thunderbirds. Thankfully early Saturday mornings one television channel still plays reruns of the series Gerry Anderson and his wife created. Jonatha Frakes should hand in his [[directors]] chair, his version was completely [[hopeless]]. A [[waste]] of film. Utter [[rubbish]]. A CGI remake may be acceptable but replacing marionettes with Homo sapiens subsp. sapiens was a huge error of judgment.","I grew up (b. 1965) watching and loving the Thunderbirds.

"When I put this movie in my DVD player, and sat down with a coke and some chips, I had some [[expectations]]. I was hoping that this movie would contain some of the strong-points of the first movie: Awsome animation, good flowing story, excellent voice cast, funny comedy and a kick-ass soundtrack. [[But]], to my [[disappointment]], not any of this is to be found in [[Atlantis]]: Milo's Return. Had I read some reviews first, I might not have been so let down. The following paragraph will be directed to those who have [[seen]] the first movie, and who enjoyed it primarily for the points mentioned.<br /><br />When the first scene appears, your in for a [[shock]] if you just picked Atlantis: Milo's Return from the display-case at your local videoshop (or whatever), and had the expectations I had. The music [[feels]] as a bad imitation of the first movie, and the voice cast has been replaced by a not so fitting one. (With the exception of a few characters, like the voice of Sweet). The actual drawings isnt that bad, but the animation in particular is a [[sad]] sight. The storyline is also [[pretty]] [[weak]], as its more like three episodes of Schooby-Doo than the single adventurous story we got the last time. But dont misunderstand, it's not very [[good]] Schooby-Doo episodes. I didnt [[laugh]] a single time, although I might have sniggered once or twice.<br /><br />To the audience who haven't seen the first movie, or don't especially care for a similar sequel, here is a fast review of this movie as a stand-alone product: If you liked schooby-doo, you might like this movie. If you didn't, you could still enjoy this movie if you have nothing else to do. And I suspect it might be a good kids movie, but I wouldn't know. It might have been better if Milo's Return had been a three-episode series on a cartoon channel, or on breakfast TV.","When I put this movie in my DVD player, and sat down with a coke and some chips, I had some [[anticipation]].

"Why do people who do not know what a particular time in the past was like feel the need to try to define that time for others? Replace Woodstock with the Civil War and the Apollo moon-landing with the Titanic sinking and you've got as realistic a flick as this formulaic soap [[opera]] populated [[entirely]] by low-life trash.

"Finally watched this [[shocking]] movie last night, and what a disturbing mindf**ker it is, and unbelievably bloody and some unforgettable scenes, and a total assault on the senses. [[Looks]] [[like]] a movie from the minds of Lynch (specifically ERASERHEAD), Buttgereit, and even a little of ""Begotten"". What this guy does to his pregnant sister is beyond belief, but then again, did it really happen or is it his brain's left and right sides doing battle. That's the main theme of this piece of art, to draw a fine line between fantasy and reality, and what would happen if the right side of the brain that dreams and fantasizes overtakes the reasoning and logical left side. And the music in this movie is unbelievable, a kind of electronic score that is absolutely perfect. Even though this movie is totally shocking and pretty disgusting in some of the most extreme scenes (including hard core sex) you will ever see in any movie, I viewed it as a work of art, and loved it. And that music still amazes me, I have to try and find the soundtrack if is available. Watching ""Subconscious Cruelty"" is a real event, and not something the viewer will easily forget. And a note to gorehounds, this is a must-have.<br /><br />Warning... Be careful buying this movie, because some prints have fogging on the graphic sex scenes and extreme gore, especially the copies from the Japanese release.","Finally watched this [[terrible]] movie last night, and what a disturbing mindf**ker it is, and unbelievably bloody and some unforgettable scenes, and a total assault on the senses.

"I caught this film on AZN on cable. It [[sounded]] like it would be a [[good]] film, a Japanese ""Green Card"". I can't say I've ever disliked an Asian film, quite the contrary.

"[[It]] [[may]] be the [[remake]] of 1987 Autumn's Tale after eleven [[years]], as the director Mabel Cheung claimed. Mabel employs rock music as the medium in this movie to express her personal attitude to life, in which love, desire and the consequential frustration play significantly crucial roles. Rock music may not be the best vehicle to convey the profound sentiment, and yet it is not too inappropriate to utilize it as the life of underground rock musicians is bitterly more intense than an ordinary one. The director focuses on the depiction of subtle affection and ultimate vanity of life [[rather]] than mere rock music. The love between father and son, lovers, and friends is [[delicately]] and [[touchingly]] delivered through the fine performance. [[Mabel]] does not attempt to beautify rock musicians as artists at all, instead, she tries to reproduce a [[true]] [[life]] on screen, [[making]] huge efforts of years' working on this project and gathering information in Beijing underground pubs.<br /><br />Daniel has given probably the best performance in all his movies made so far.
